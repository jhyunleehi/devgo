Running a Go application as a daemon means running it as a background process without any direct interaction with the user. Creating a daemon involves detaching the process from the terminal, closing the standard input/output/error, creating a new session, and typically, changing the current working directory to root.

In Unix-like operating systems, the common way to daemonize an application is to use fork() system calls, but Go does not directly support fork(). However, you can achieve daemonization using third-party packages or by using external system tools like systemd, upstart, or supervisord.

Below are two approaches: one using a Go package and the other using systemd.

1. Using the github.com/sevlyar/go-daemon package:
First, install the package:

bash
Copy code
go get github.com/sevlyar/go-daemon
Then, create your daemon application:

go
Copy code
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"os/signal"
	"syscall"
	"time"

	"github.com/sevlyar/go-daemon"
)

func main() {
	context := &daemon.Context{
		PidFileName: "sample.pid",
		PidFilePerm: 0644,
		LogFileName: "sample.log",
		LogFilePerm: 0640,
		WorkDir:     "./",
		Umask:       027,
	}

	child, err := context.Reborn()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal("Unable to run: ", err)
	}
	if child != nil {
		// Parent process
		return
	}
	defer context.Release()

	fmt.Println("Daemon started")

	// Run your main loop here
	go worker()

	// Handling shutdown
	ch := make(chan os.Signal, 1)
	signal.Notify(ch, syscall.SIGTERM, syscall.SIGINT)
	<-ch
}

func worker() {
	for {
		// Do some work here
		fmt.Println("Doing some work...")
		time.Sleep(5 * time.Second)
	}
}
Run your application normally, and it'll start as a daemon.

2. Using systemd:
You can create a systemd service to run your Go application as a daemon. Here's how:

Write your Go application without any daemon-specific code:
go
Copy code
// main.go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	for {
		fmt.Println("Doing some work...")
		time.Sleep(5 * time.Second)
	}
}
Build your application:
bash
Copy code
go build main.go
Create a systemd service file:
ini
Copy code
# /etc/systemd/system/myapp.service
[Unit]
Description=My Go App

[Service]
ExecStart=/path/to/your/binary
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
Reload systemd and start your service:
bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start myapp.service
If you want your service to start on boot:
bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl enable myapp.service
The second method with systemd is more preferred in modern Linux distributions, as it provides process management, logging, and more without any need for additional code in the Go application itself.

show me example about to get mutex key  using mariadb table column
ChatGPT
Using a database like MariaDB to implement a mutex (or mutual exclusion) mechanism can be a useful way to prevent simultaneous access to a resource across distributed systems. This approach ensures that regardless of how many instances of your application are running or where they're running, only one instance can acquire the mutex at a time.

One common way to implement a mutex with MariaDB is to use a row-level lock. You can attempt to update a specific row, and if the update is successful, you know you've acquired the mutex. If the update fails because another instance already holds the lock, then you wait and try again later.

Here's an example using Go's database/sql package with the go-sql-driver/mysql driver to acquire a mutex using a specific row in a MariaDB table:

Setup:

Install the MySQL driver:

bash
Copy code
go get -u github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql
Create a table in MariaDB:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE mutex_table (
    mutex_key VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
    locked_by VARCHAR(255),
    lock_time TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

INSERT INTO mutex_table (mutex_key, locked_by) VALUES ('MY_MUTEX', NULL);
Go code:

go
Copy code
package main

import (
	"database/sql"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"time"

	_ "github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql"
)

const dsn = "user:password@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/your_database"

func acquireMutex(db *sql.DB, instanceName string) bool {
	_, err := db.Exec(`
		UPDATE mutex_table
		SET locked_by = ?, lock_time = NOW()
		WHERE mutex_key = 'MY_MUTEX' AND (locked_by IS NULL OR TIMESTAMPDIFF(SECOND, lock_time, NOW()) > 10)`,
		instanceName)

	if err != nil {
		return false
	}

	return true
}

func main() {
	db, err := sql.Open("mysql", dsn)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to connect to database: %v", err)
	}
	defer db.Close()

	instanceName := fmt.Sprintf("Instance_%d", time.Now().Unix())

	for {
		if acquireMutex(db, instanceName) {
			fmt.Println(instanceName, "acquired the mutex!")
			time.Sleep(5 * time.Second) // Simulate some work
		} else {
			fmt.Println(instanceName, "failed to acquire the mutex. Retrying...")
			time.Sleep(2 * time.Second) // Wait before retrying
		}
	}
}
In this example:

The acquireMutex function tries to lock the mutex by updating the mutex_table.
If locked_by is NULL (indicating the mutex is free) or the lock is older than 10 seconds (as a fail-safe in case the holder of the mutex crashes), another instance can take over the mutex.
Each instance has a unique name based on the current Unix timestamp for demonstration purposes.
This approach works, but remember that it's not as efficient as using in-memory mutex mechanisms or distributed coordination services like ZooKeeper or etcd. Use it when you already have a database in place and don't want to add more components to your system. Always be aware of the potential for deadlocks and design your system accordingly.

auth.go unknown auth plugin:auth_gssapi_client
ChatGPT
The error unknown auth plugin: auth_gssapi_client typically occurs when your Go application, using the MySQL driver, is trying to connect to a MySQL or MariaDB server that requires GSSAPI authentication, but the Go driver doesn't know how to handle this authentication method.

GSSAPI (Generic Security Service Application Program Interface) is a standard interface for accessing security services. auth_gssapi_client is the client-side plugin for MySQL's GSSAPI authentication.

To fix this issue:

Use a Different Authentication Method:

If you have control over the MySQL/MariaDB server, consider changing the user's authentication method to something more commonly supported like mysql_native_password:

sql
Copy code
ALTER USER 'your_user'@'your_host' IDENTIFIED WITH 'mysql_native_password' BY 'your_password';
Then, flush the privileges:

sql
Copy code
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
Use a Different MySQL Client/Driver:

There might be other MySQL clients or drivers for Go which have better support for the latest authentication plugins.

Reconfigure the MySQL Server:

If you cannot alter the user's authentication method for some reason and you must use GSSAPI, you might need to configure your MySQL server correctly to support GSSAPI authentication, ensuring all required plugins and dependencies are installed and configured.

Driver Limitation:

At the time of my last update (September 2021), the go-sql-driver/mysql did not support GSSAPI authentication. Keep an eye on the repository for any updates or new features related to this.

Fallback to Using a Different Language or Tool:

If using GSSAPI is a hard requirement, and you cannot achieve this in Go, consider using a different language or tool where the MySQL client supports this authentication method.

Always ensure that your Go packages and MySQL server are updated to their latest versions. Sometimes issues are related to using outdated software, and upgrading might resolve them.
